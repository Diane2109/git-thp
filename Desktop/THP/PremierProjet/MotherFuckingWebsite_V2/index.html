    		<p>Really, it is.</p>

			<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
			<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB motherfuckingwebsite(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
			<p><strong>WRONG</strong>, motherfucker.</p>
			<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
			<p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past motherfuckingwebsites:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
				<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the Google home page</li>
				<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
				<li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
				<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <a id="tiny">well, kind of</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
			<p>This website is even better than the last guy and the guy before him.</p>
			<p>Why?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It's over a secure connection - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
				<li>It uses one of the most general gTLDs available out there: .website</li>
				<li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out domainr to do something cool too.</li>
				<li>It uses the kickassing Let's Encrypt CA (don't you see the gorgeous green lock?)</li>
				<li>It runs on nginx: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>
			<p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
			
			<h2>It's responsive</h2>
			<p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>

			<h2>It fucking works</h2>
			<p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>

			<p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>

			<p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>

			<h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
			<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>

			<h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
			<p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>

			<h2>Epilogue</h2>
			<p>From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, <a href="http://txti.es/">txti</a> was created. You should try it today to make your own motherfucking websites.</p>
